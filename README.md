# Racing

This is a racing game where the player controls the car by using the left key and the right key of the keyboard. There is also the speed and scoreboard on the top of the screen.
When the playerâ€™s car collides with the enemy car (coming from opposite directions) the game is over. There is a restart button that can restart the game when it is over.
